## React Native Guess My Number App

This is a simple React Native app that lets users play the "Guess My Number" game.
The goal of the game is to guess the number that the person is thinking of, which is a random number between 1 and 99.

### Getting Started

To install this app, you will need to have Node.js and React Native installed on your machine.
Once you have those installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run ```npm install``` to install the dependencies.
3. Run ```npm start``` to start the development server.

### Usage

To use the app, you can run it on your local device using the following commands:

For iOS: ```npm run i```
For Android: ```npm run a```

### How to Play

1. When the game starts, the app will generate a random number between 1 and 99.

2. The user must then guess the number by entering their guess into the text input and tapping the "Guess" button.

3. After each guess, the app will give the user a hint to help them narrow down the range of possible numbers. The hint will tell the user whether their guess is higher or lower than the app's number.

4. The user can continue guessing until they correctly guess the app's number.

5. Once the user has guessed the correct number, the app will display a message congratulating them and offering the option to play again.
